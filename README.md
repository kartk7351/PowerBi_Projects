# PowerBi_Projects
BI projectðŸ“ˆ on Global Health Expenditure Analysis. 
I loaded the data from the CSV file that was provided by Newton School, which contains detailed information about global health expenditure .
 I used the Power query editor to clean and transform the data, such as removing duplicates, filling missing values, splitting columns, and renaming tables.
I used new measures and some DAX functions for the KPI visual, such as calculating Total GDP, Total Expenditure, % of Expenditure, Average Growth % and Maximum Expenditure Country.
I created a dashboard with several visualizations, such as a Card Visual, Slicers, Line Chart, Scatter Chart, Map to show the key insights.
I applied some filters and slicers to allow interactive exploration of the data, such as selecting country name and year.
